      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        This Computer Science Capstone project is sponsored by <a href="https://eng.ua.edu/eng-directory/dr-monica-anderson/">Dr. Monica Anderson Herzog</a>. The purpose of this project is to create a platform for Dr. Anderson to manage new and ongoing senior design projects. This platform should allow project sponsors (who may or may not be affiliated with the University of Alabama) to submit and update projects for Dr. Anderson to approve of and assign to students each semester. This platform should allow students to submit their preferences for which project they wish to work on, so that this may be considered by Dr. Anderson before matching students to projects each semester. This project is initially being designed for the Computer Science and Cybersecurity programs, but may be expanded to support other programs within the college of engineering at a later semester.
